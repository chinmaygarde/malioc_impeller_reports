Configuration
=============

Hardware: Mali-G310 r0p0
Architecture: Valhall
Driver: r39p0-00rel0
Shader type: OpenGL ES Fragment

Compiler messages
=================

INFO: Mali-G310 reports assume a 32 FMA/cycle and 4 Texture op/cycle core configuration.
      Other core configurations might have 16-64 FMA/cycle and 2-8 Texture op/cycle.

Main shader
===========

Work registers: 22 (68% used at 100% occupancy)
Uniform registers: 10 (15% used)
Stack spilling: false
16-bit arithmetic: 0%

                                A      LS       V       T    Bound
Total instruction cycles:    0.62    0.00    0.25    0.25        A
Shortest path cycles:        0.09    0.00    0.00    0.00        A
Longest path cycles:          N/A     N/A     N/A     N/A      N/A

A = Arithmetic, LS = Load/Store, V = Varying, T = Texture
