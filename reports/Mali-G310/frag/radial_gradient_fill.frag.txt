Configuration
=============

Hardware: Mali-G310 r0p0
Architecture: Valhall
Driver: r39p0-00rel0
Shader type: OpenGL ES Fragment

Compiler messages
=================

INFO: Mali-G310 reports assume a 32 FMA/cycle and 4 Texture op/cycle core configuration.
      Other core configurations might have 16-64 FMA/cycle and 2-8 Texture op/cycle.

Main shader
===========

Work registers: 20 (62% used at 100% occupancy)
Uniform registers: 14 (21% used)
Stack spilling: false
16-bit arithmetic: 0%

                                A      LS       V       T    Bound
Total instruction cycles:    0.86    0.00    0.25    0.25        A
Shortest path cycles:        0.50    0.00    0.25    0.00        A
Longest path cycles:         0.75    0.00    0.25    0.25        A

A = Arithmetic, LS = Load/Store, V = Varying, T = Texture

Shader properties
=================

Has uniform computation: true
Has side-effects: false
Modifies coverage: false
Uses late ZS test: false
Uses late ZS update: false
Reads color buffer: false

Note: This tool shows only the shader-visible property state.
API configuration may also impact the value of some properties.
