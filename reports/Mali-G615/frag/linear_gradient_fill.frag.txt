Shader type: OpenGL ES Fragment

Main shader
===========

Work registers: 20 (62% used at 100% occupancy)
Uniform registers: 16 (25% used)
Stack spilling: false
16-bit arithmetic: 0%

                                A      LS       V       T    Bound
Total instruction cycles:    0.23    0.00    0.06    0.12        A
Shortest path cycles:        0.12    0.00    0.06    0.00        A
Longest path cycles:         0.20    0.00    0.06    0.12        A
