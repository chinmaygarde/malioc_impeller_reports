Configuration
=============

Hardware: Mali-G510 r0p0
Architecture: Valhall
Driver: r39p0-00rel0
Shader type: OpenGL ES Fragment

Compiler messages
=================

INFO: Mali-G510 reports assume a 48 FMA/cycle and 8 Texture op/cycle core configuration.
      Other core configurations might have 48-64 FMA/cycle and 4-8 Texture op/cycle.

Main shader
===========

Work registers: 19 (59% used at 100% occupancy)
Uniform registers: 6 (9% used)
Stack spilling: false
16-bit arithmetic: 0%

                                A      LS       V       T    Bound
Total instruction cycles:    0.17    0.00    0.38    0.12        V
Shortest path cycles:        0.15    0.00    0.38    0.12        V
Longest path cycles:         0.17    0.00    0.38    0.12        V

A = Arithmetic, LS = Load/Store, V = Varying, T = Texture
